#The olive dataset in dslabs contains composition in percentage of eight fatty acids found

#Plot the percent palmitic acid versus palmitoleic acid in a scatterplot. 
#What relationship do you see?

#-- ANS: There is a positive linear relationship between palmitic and palmitoleic. 

##9
#Create a histogram of the percentage of eicosenoic acid in olive.

#-- ANS: The most common value of eicosenoic acid is below 0.05%.
